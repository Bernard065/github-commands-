# What is Git

Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changed in source code during software development.

Start with configuring git to work with your name and email.

> `git config --global user.name "Name"`

> `git config --global user.email "email@gmail.com"`

# Initialize a git repository

> `git init`
> Initializes a new git repository. This command creates a new Git repository in the current directory. It sets up the basic files and the directories need to start tracking changes.
